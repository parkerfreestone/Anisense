# Anisense 🌸🍙

Anisense is a comprehensive social media application for Anime enthusiasts. The platform not only offers tailored Anime recommendations using a Python and TensorFlow-based recommendation engine, but also provides users with a platform to track, rate, and share their Anime experiences. With Anisense, you can add your watched and currently watching Anime to your profile and even rank your watched Anime with a special emphasis on your "Top 5" 🏆📺.

The application includes a web frontend built with React, a mobile app built with React Native, a server API built with Laravel, and the aforementioned recommendation engine with python.

## API-Layer 🌐

The api-layer directory houses our Laravel backend. This serves as a RESTful API service that handles all the data management and business logic of the application. It interacts with the other components of the application, providing data to the frontend and mobile app, and interfacing with the recommendation engine to generate Anime recommendations.

## Webapp 💻

The webapp directory contains our React-based web frontend. This is where users can interact with their Anime list, view recommendations, and connect with other users. This directory contains all of our React components, styles, and API service functions.
mobile 📱

The mobile directory contains our React Native mobile application. It offers similar functionality as the web frontend but is designed for mobile devices.

## Recommendation Engine (Prospective) 🤖

The recommendation directory is home to our Python-based recommendation engine. It uses TensorFlow to generate Anime recommendations based on user data. This recommendation engine operates independently, with its own API that the Laravel backend can call when needed.

_KEEP IN MIND ALL OF THIS IS PROSPECTIVE, AS THE PROJECT IS EVER CHANGING AND NOTHING IS CONCRETE!_
